# Graph-Convolutional-Network-MUTAG-data-

Graph classification with Graph Convolutional Networks in PyTorch: 

GCN is implemented on MUTAG data set which is a collection of graphs representing chemical compounds with each graph associated with a binary label. This binary label corresponds to the compoundâ€™s mutagenicity, which is the ability to cause changes in the genetic material (DNA) of living organisms, such as bacteria.
